Hi I loop through tweets 
@jessicagarson saw Tenement a few weeks back 
@jon_m_rob was with me too, it was fun!
I like one of their songs
I'm going to sing it
Sometimes I sing songs 
Nothing is darker than a wick
Smokin' in the wind
Left there, out of breath
Wondering what to do next
Scared and happy at the same time
I'm retracing all my steps
Falling in love again
Break my knuckles open
Glue them back in place
Will it ever feel the same?
I'm walking in the rain
